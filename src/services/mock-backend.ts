## Question Analysis
The student has attempted to solve the problem by:

1. **Identifying key variables**: The student correctly identified the main variables in the problem
2. **Setting up equations**: Basic equation setup is present
3. **Calculation steps**: Shows work for most calculations

## Solution Steps
\`\`\`
Given: x = 5, y = 3
Find: z = x¬≤ + 2y

Step 1: Calculate x¬≤
x¬≤ = 5¬≤ = 25

Step 2: Calculate 2y
2y = 2 √ó 3 = 6

Step 3: Add results
z = 25 + 6 = 31
\`\`\`

## Final Answer
z = 31

## Notes
- Shows understanding of basic algebraic operations
- Work is clearly presented
- Minor calculation error in step 2 (should be 2y = 6, not 7)`;
    } else {
      return `# Professor Model Answer

## Complete Solution

### Problem Statement
Given x = 5 and y = 3, find z = x¬≤ + 2y

### Detailed Solution
\`\`\`
Step 1: Substitute given values
x = 5, y = 3
z = x¬≤ + 2y

Step 2: Calculate x¬≤
x¬≤ = 5¬≤ = 25

Step 3: Calculate 2y
2y = 2 √ó 3 = 6

Step 4: Sum the results
z = x¬≤ + 2y = 25 + 6 = 31
\`\`\`

### Final Answer
**z = 31**

### Grading Criteria
